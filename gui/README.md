# FASTag desktop GUI

A cross-platform desktop front-end for the FASTag CLI, built with
[Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) (Rust backend + the OS's own webview) and React.
The CLI stays the source of truth: the GUI shells out to it, streams its
progress, and renders the tags, the species report and the digest, label and
mass-gap reports.

Tauri uses the OS's own webview rather than a bundled Chromium, so the app
itself adds only a few MB on top of what it carries; the release bundle is
dominated by the bundled CLI and its ~1 GB taxonomy (see Packaging), about
1.3 GB installed on macOS. The React frontend speaks to an abstract
`window.fastag` bridge (`src/api.ts`), which is the only surface the Rust
backend has to satisfy.

## Layout

```
gui/
  src/                 React frontend (App, ParamField, SpeciesPanel, DigestPanel, api bridge)
    digestReport.ts    reader of the digest/label/mass-gap TSVs and the sequence-logo arithmetic
    SequenceLogo.tsx   SVG sequence logo (bits against a background)
    fixtures/          synthetic report TSVs for the tests and the browser preview
    api.ts             the window.fastag bridge over Tauri invoke/events + dialog/opener plugins
    paramLayout.ts     section/ordering overlay on the generated manifest (one flat list)
    params.generated.json   `-write_ini` dump of the tool (the source of truth for params)
  src-tauri/           Rust backend
    src/fastag.rs      resolve/probe the binary, run it, stream stderr and stdout lines as events, cancel
    src/settings.rs    named presets + last-used, atomic JSON in the app config dir
    src/browser.rs     indexed million-row results browser
    src/species.rs     species TSV read + FTX2 taxdb header read
    src/report.rs      digest/label/mass-gap report read
    tauri.conf.json    window, bundle, icons
    resources/fastag/  the bundled FASTag binary + share/ (dev: symlinks; release: real files)
```

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

`resolve_binary` (`src-tauri/src/fastag.rs`) looks for the CLI in this order:
`FASTAG_BIN` (if that file exists), then `resources/fastag/bin/FASTag` in the
app's resource directory. A release build stops there: without a bundled CLI
(and no `FASTAG_BIN`) it reports the CLI missing. A debug build (`tauri dev`)
adds two fallbacks: the same path under this crate's own `src-tauri/`
(compiled in as `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`), then `FASTag` on `PATH` (`FASTag.exe` on
Windows, which the Windows CLI zip does not contain: it ships `FASTag.bat` and
`FASTag.core.exe`, so there the `PATH` step finds nothing). For dev, point it
at a local build with `FASTAG_BIN=/path/to/FASTag npm run tauri dev`, or drop a
symlink at `src-tauri/resources/fastag/bin/FASTag`.

`npm run dev` opened in a browser (http://localhost:1420) shows the React part
without the backend: a mock bridge stands in, and "open a report" loads the
fixture reports. A production build does not contain it.

## Build

```bash
npm run tauri build              # release .app/.dmg/.msi/.deb/.AppImage
npm run tauri build -- --debug   # faster, unsigned, for local checking
```

## Regenerate the param manifest

The UI form is generated from the tool's own `-write_ini`. After changing a CLI
parameter, refresh the manifest so the form stays in lockstep, and place the
new option in `src/paramLayout.ts` (the layout tests fail until it is placed):

```bash
npm run params    # runs scripts/gen-params.mjs against the bundled binary
```

The bundled binary is gitignored; without it, name one:
`node scripts/gen-params.mjs /path/to/FASTag src/params.generated.json`. The
script replaces the manifest only once it is complete, so a missing or broken
binary leaves the old one in place. Do not redirect its stdout into the
manifest: the shell empties the file before the script runs.

## Tests

Rust unit tests cover the trust boundaries (`build_args` allowlist and
flag-injection defence, settings sanitisation, species/taxdb parsing, report
reading, browser bounds): `cargo test` in `src-tauri/` (it needs
`src-tauri/resources/fastag` to exist, even empty). The frontend has vitest
tests (run/batch orchestration, layout completeness, results browser, report
parsing and logo arithmetic, Digest tab) and a typecheck: `npm test`,
`npm run typecheck`.

The tests in `src/adversarial/` pin the GUI design-review findings. Some of
them read inputs from outside the repository and are skipped unless these are
set: `FASTAG_GUI_REVIEW_SCRATCH` (a directory of real CLI outputs on the E. coli
fixture), `FASTAG_BIN` (a FASTag CLI to run) and `FASTAG_ORDER_RS` (a helper
that replays stdout/stderr in the order two reader threads receive them).
`cli-consistency` also needs the `build_args` example, which `cargo test`
builds. See `src/adversarial/external.ts`.

## Packaging

Release bundles carry the CLI, its dylib closure with a single `libomp` (which
avoids OpenMP error #15), the digest tables (`share/FASTag/digest`) and the
~1 GB taxonomy inside the app; see
[../doc/SIGNING-macos-gui.md](../doc/SIGNING-macos-gui.md). In dev those
resources are machine-specific symlinks and are gitignored.
